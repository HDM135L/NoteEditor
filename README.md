# NodeEditor

# The main program is temporarily in "NoteEditor.py"

# (maybe will be moved to "main.py" later)

> The two of the problems in the video are fixed: 
>> 1. The screen will flash when unpaused
>> 2. If the screen is paused before clicking on 'add' etc. buttons, after the tkinter window is closed, the music and the screen will not go in sync

# Thus you don't have to worry about the 2 problems
